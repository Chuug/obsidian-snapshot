### Labs
#### 1. No defenses - [Lab](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Cyber%20Pentest%2FWeb%2FAPI%2FLabs%2F1.%20Finding%20and%20exploiting%20an%20unused%20API%20endpoint)
*CSRF vulnerability with no defenses*
If the form has no defense, just craft a simple page as shown in the lab.

#### 2. Token validation depends on request method - [Lab](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Cyber%20Pentest%2FWeb%2FCSRF%2FLabs%2F2.%20CSRF%20where%20token%20validation%20depends%20on%20request%20method)
*CSRF where token validation depends on request method*
If the `POST` form can be changed in `GET` form, I may bypass the token

#### 3. Token is removeable - [Lab](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Cyber%20Pentest%2FWeb%2FCSRF%2FLabs%2F3.%20CSRF%20where%20token%20validation%20depends%20on%20token%20being%20present)
*CSRF where token validation depends on token being present*

#### 4. Shared tokens - [Lab](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Cyber%20Pentest%2FWeb%2FCSRF%2FLabs%2F4.%20CSRF%20where%20token%20is%20not%20tied%20to%20user%20session)
*CSRF where token is not tied to user session*
