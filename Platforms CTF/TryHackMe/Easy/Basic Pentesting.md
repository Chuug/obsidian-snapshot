Firstly, I nmap all the port

Then, I do a more aggressive scan on the discovered port

I found messages on /development after a gobuster

I connected on smb as Anonymous with
```shell
smbclient //10.10.84.74/Anonymous
```
I've got a file `staff.txt` with 2 usernames Jan and Kay. Jan has a weak password, I'll bruteforce it

We have access to Kay's .ssh key

I've download the id_rsa key and cracked it with john the ripper
```shell
ssh2john id_rsa > hash
```

Then I connected through ssh on kay's account with the password `beeswax`
```shell
ssh kay@10.10.84.74 -i id_rsa 
```
